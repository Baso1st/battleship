# Hello, and welcome to Battleship

## To Start the game run gameloop.py
**Please read the following before you run the game:**

    The game right now is set to auto mode. So once you start, it will make random gusses and play automatically against the computer, but you can change that in the code.


### Game features. (checked means done ;) 
- [x] Play against the computer.
- [x] Support more than two players.
- [x] Different winning strategies (Annihilation, Score, TimeLimit).
- [X] Change the board to be a matrix instead of a hash_table.
- [ ] Allow players to choose a Placement strategy(Manual, Auto).
- [ ] Change the way the winning strategy works to use observable pattern, to get notified when a player is hit or destroyed.
- [ ] Need to add a game_config class to pass to the game class. It should contain, row_count, col_count, player_count, etc...
- [ ] Different types of boards (square, rectangle, circle, etc...).
- [ ] Get rid of all the ToDo comments.
